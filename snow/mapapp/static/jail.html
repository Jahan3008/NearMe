    A sub jail is a smaller detention facility designed to house individuals who are either awaiting trial, serving short-term sentences, or involved in minor offenses. These jails typically operate under the jurisdiction of local law enforcement and are often located in smaller towns, rural areas, or regions where there is no need for a larger, central prison. The primary purpose of sub jails is to alleviate overcrowding in district or central jails, providing temporary accommodation for individuals before they are transferred to larger facilities. Sub jails usually have limited capacity and resources compared to major correctional institutions, and they may house a smaller number of inmates.

    Inmates in sub jails might not have access to extensive rehabilitation programs or advanced amenities. These facilities are focused on basic security and housing, with minimal staffing and simpler operations. While they serve a functional role in the prison system, conditions in sub jails can vary significantly depending on location and funding. Due to their limited scale, sub jails often face challenges related to overcrowding, insufficient resources, and lack of oversight, but they remain an important component of the broader criminal justice system. Their existence helps manage the flow of detainees, ensuring that larger jails and prisons remain more organized and less burdened.
